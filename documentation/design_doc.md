# Design document

The Compressiontron compresses text files' data in such a way as to make them consume less space on disk. At the very least two 
algorithms will be implemented, the Huffman coding and the arithmetic coding algorithms. Both are forms of lossless data 
compression.

# I/O

The program takes as input either text files or encoded text files and outputs one or more of the following: an encoded 
text file, a decoded text file, benchmarking results. These depend on the input and used command line switches. More on 
program usage [here](https://github.com/duckling747/Compressiontron/blob/master/documentation/user_guide.md). 

As the emphasis of the course (for which this program is created for) is on the data structures and algorithms, no specially 
crafted UI will be implemented. Please read the user guide for more detailed info.
