# Week 1

[Hour reports](https://github.com/duckling747/Compressiontron/blob/master/documentation/hour_reports.md)

## Happenings during week 1

* Project creation, signing up with labtool and some basic setting up happened.
* Created a few classes and thought about the design for the algorithms. 
* Did some research on how these compression things actually work. 
* Tried to find a good book with some detailed explanations of different compression algorithms. So far found one. 

Most of the time spent went to designing and deciding on implementation. A lot of consideration went to not have the design be too 
simple. A nice middle way between "ambitious" and "clear cut" had to be found. 

## Problems 

It's been way too long since I last saw any binary operations, so catching up on some bit shifting took away too much time. Also 
some generic confusion over the time complexity of the arithmetic coding took away a couple of hours, until I just decided to see 
what the end result will look like once it's done. Easier to just judge the complexity of the finished code, but hopefully I 
understood the workings of the algorithm already well enough. 

Found a book about compression algorithms that I wanted to read, but had some definite problems with usernames and forgotten 
passwords regarding EBSCO. Yeah. Trying to solve those as quickly as possible. 

## Questions 

None this week. 

## Next week 

The basic core of the algorithms should be completed. Especially the Huffman one, since it seems somewhat simpler of the two.
